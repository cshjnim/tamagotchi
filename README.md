# TAMAGOTCHI

**TAMAGOTCHI** is a GAME!

The Tamagotchi (たまごっち) is a handheld digital pet, created in Japan by Akihiro Yokoi of WiZ and Aki Maita of Bandai, the game that became one of the biggest toy fads of the 1990s and early 2000s.
This app allows the user to play a narrative based on the old amazing game once again!
